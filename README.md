# ⚡ NumPy Playground 🧠

Welcome to my **NumPy Learning Repository** – a hands-on lab where I explored the powerful world of **NumPy**, the foundational library for scientific computing in Python.

This repo contains bite-sized yet effective notebooks and scripts showcasing various operations, optimizations, and data manipulations using NumPy.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

Here's a breakdown of what I've learned and implemented:

| 📌 Topic                   | 🔍 Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧮 Fundamentals of NumPy  | Arrays, array creation methods, data types, indexing & slicing               |
| ⚡ Vectorization           | Speeding up operations using element-wise arithmetic and avoiding loops      |
| 🔁 Broadcasting           | Working with arrays of different shapes, auto-expanding dimensions           |
| 🔄 Reshaping              | `.reshape()`, `.ravel()`, `.flatten()`, `.transpose()`                       |
| 📉 Missing Values         | Handling `np.nan`, `np.isnan()`, `np.where()`, and data imputation techniques|
| 🔍 Properties & Metadata  | `.shape`, `.ndim`, `.dtype`, `.itemsize`, and more                            |
| 🧪 Useful Functions       | `np.sum()`, `np.mean()`, `np.std()`, `np.argsort()`, `np.unique()`, etc.     |
